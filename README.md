# Goals
The goal of this project is to explore trends and analyze various aspects of publicly available spotify data, using R.
Dataset pulled from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdulszz/spotify-most-streamed-songs
Dataset used for the Data Cleaning testing: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amruthayenikonda/dirty-dataset-to-practice-data-cleaning

The primary comparison that will be focused on is popularity and what tends to make a song more popular and successful. Some of the factors that will be graphed and compared are beats per minute, key, number of playlists the song appears in, and number of words in a song. The data file not only provides Spotify data but also Apple Music, Deezer, and Shazam. This allows us to compare the streaming of different songs on different services to see if there are different patterns on different platforms or if they match up.
